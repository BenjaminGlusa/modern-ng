The `feature-component` itself will be the smart (routed) component.

Anything related to managing data, like `services` and `stores`, will be in the `data-access` folder.

The `ui` folder will hold the `dump components` and the feature specific `directives`.

Other `helpers` and `utils` will live in the `utils-folder`.
